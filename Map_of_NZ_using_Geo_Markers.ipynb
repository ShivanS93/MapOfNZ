    "# Map of NZ using Geodetic Markers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use a geodetic markers to build a map of New Zealand.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, What are \"Geodetic makers\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer, we need a short story.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December of 2020, I took a small family holiday to [Mt. Maunganui](https://www.newzealand.com/int/mount-maunganui/). Of the many activiies or lack there of, we devided to climb [Mauao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Maunganui_(mountain))... twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the summit, you are welcomed by a geodetic marker. And also amazing views of the township and beach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I thought of an idea to map all the markers in New Zealand and colour them based on elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get stuck in, we will have a look at some learning points, which this post will provide.\n",
    "* How to use pandas to load .csv data\n",
    "* How to vary alpha in matplotlib using cmap\n",
    "* pandas groupby method and aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to access the data\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a hold of the data we are going to use the [Koordinates website](https://koordinates.com/). This company is responsible for housing most the geospatial data for New Zealand. We will require to create an account to access this data but will is completely free.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can search for [NZ Geodetic Vertical Marks](https://koordinates.com/from/data.linz.govt.nz/layer/50784/). This data is curated by the members of [Land Information New Zealand website](https://www.linz.govt.nz/). Selecting *Vertical Marks* gives us heights in a particular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to heights, a simple measurement isn't that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting into too much detail, vertical datums resemble what is known as normal-orthometric heights. This is what we are most familiar with as height above sea level. Normal-orthometric height is actually the mean/average heights at sea level (as sea level can change with tide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipsoidal heights is another form of height, which approximates Earth as a ellipsoid and uses this as a point of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The LINZ website goes into this with more detail](https://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-system/datums-projections-and-heights/vertical-datums)."
